# Premake GLFW Project Template

This project is just a basic starting point for a project structure that I enjoy, and loads a few useful libraries for working with opengl.

#### Libraries: GLM, GLFW, GLAD, STB_IMAGE, and STB_TRUETYPE

I disliked cmake so I'm switching to premake. I know very little so this is still somewhat cobbled together but as far as I can tell it's working properly.

**Inside of the main premake5.lua, you can edit the project name, same goes for the core and derived in their respective files, make sure you change the links and includedirs to reflect any changes.**
